# MockServer
A small mock server that will create endpoints based on json files of the "mocks" folder.

### Reproduce

- create a "mocks" folder in the root of the project
- add some folders or .json files inside of the "mocks" folder and this will create endpoints based on directory of the file
- install the packages, present in the "requirements.txt". You can run on terminal "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
- run on terminal "python3 main.py"
